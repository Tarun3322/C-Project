Algorithm:

1. Declare a structure with just one 3D array of type int with size [4][3][2]

2. Use rand() function to assign values to the array

3. Access [2][2][2] element of the array using a pointer and assign it to a variable 'var'

4. If var is divisible by 10, jump to a label called 'pattern' that prints
 a
 ab
 abc
 abcd
abcde

5. If var is even, invoke a function using function pointer that compares two strings recursively considering case sensitivity. Input strings from the user.

6. If var is odd, invoke a fn using fn ptr that counts the occurances of a character in a string- take the string and character from user 

Requirements:

1. Use one file per function
2. Compile using Makefile
3. Execute using gdb
4. Upload to github under branch name 'C Project'
